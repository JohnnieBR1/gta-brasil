------- Instructions:

Extract the folder "Beard Grow" to your Modloader folder.

 Folder "(adaptation)" includes adaptations for other player mods.
 Just grab the "beard.txd" file and replace it in "modloader/Beard Grow".

-- Download the latest version of Modloader: MixMods.com.br/2015/01/SA-Modloader.html



 = First test:
Because it takes 4 days for the beard to grow (by default), I recommend that you test the mod first with the YSOHNUL/TIMEJUSTFLIESBY cheat
You can also choose the number of gays in the file "BeardGrow.ini".
Check the "BeardGrow.log" file for error messages.
If the "beard.txd" you are using is not adapted to your current player, it will give you an error message there.


 = Important:
Whenever the hairstyle is changed, the beard is considered cut off.
That is, mods that change the hairstyle will always "cut" the beard. Keep this in mind.


 = How to adapt:
If you want to adapt the mod to a player that is currently not compatible, simply open the file "beard.txd" with Magic.TXD and edit the texture by exporting and importing again.
Note that it's necessary for the player face texture to be at the same resolution as the beard texture.
Do not leave transparent "semi-pixels" in the texture image, cut it without anti-aliasing, otherwise the CJ may appear with holes around the beard.
DO NOT add compression and mipmaps to the .txd texture, otherwise it will crash. Unless some future mod makes it possible.
