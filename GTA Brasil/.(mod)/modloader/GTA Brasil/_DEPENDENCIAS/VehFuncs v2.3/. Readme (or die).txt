------- Instructions:

Extract the folder "VehFuncs" to your Modloader folder.

-- RECOMMENDED IndieVehicles.asi (for some functions): MixMods.com.br/2019/06/IndieVehicles.html



ATTENTION: The mod includes "gsx.asi", make sure that you don't already have it installed by another mod that also uses it.

Learn how to adapt a vehicle here: https://github.com/JuniorDjjr/VehFuncs/wiki

There's a basic logging sytem. You can find infos, errors etc in file "VehFuncs.log" at mod asi folder.
The mod also detect and shows informations about some common vehicle crash errors.
It's written when closing or defocus (e.g. minimize) the game.
 
If you don't really need the .log (are you sure the mod is working fine),
you can disable it in VehFuncs.ini under "Log" for a small performance improvement if you have too many adapted cars.
