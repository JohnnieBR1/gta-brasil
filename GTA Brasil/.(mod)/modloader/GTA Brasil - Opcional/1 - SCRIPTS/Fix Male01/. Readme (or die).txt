------- Instructions:

Extract the folder "Fix MALE01" to your Modloader folder.

-- Download the latest version of Modloader: MixMods.com.br/2015/01/SA-Modloader.html
 

Remember: this mod does not remove MALE01 from the game, it just prevents it from appearing in places that don't make sense.
You will still see it in some cases.


Version: v2.0b3
