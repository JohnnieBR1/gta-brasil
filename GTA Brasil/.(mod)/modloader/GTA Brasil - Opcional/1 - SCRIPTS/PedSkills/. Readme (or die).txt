------- Instructions:

Extract the folder "PedSkills" to your Modloader folder.

-- Download the latest version of Modloader: MixMods.com.br/2015/01/SA-Modloader.html


 It's already configured with a configuration (.ini) that makes the game a little more difficult.
 Check other options in "(settings)" folder.

 ATTENTION: Some weapon.dat mods already increase the distance and accuracy of weapons,
            and this mod also does this, but in A.I., so if you use it, the difficulty of
            game can get too high.


Version: v2.1
